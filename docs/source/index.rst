Grid Cells Conductance-based Model
----------------------------------

A conductance-based model of `Grid cells <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_cell>`_, implemented using the `NEURON <https://www.neuron.yale.edu/>`_ 
simulator with parallelized functionality for efficient simulations. Grid cells are crucial for spatial navigation, and this model replicates their dynamics 
with biologically realistic conductances.

**Key Features**:

* Conductance-based implementation of Stellate cells and Inhibitory Interneurons of the medial entorhinal cortex.
* Parallelized Simulation: leveraging NEURON for multi-core simulations to handle large networks efficiently.
* User-Friendly Code: Clear structure with modular components for easy setup, modification, and analysis.
